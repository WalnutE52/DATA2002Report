## Hypothesis Test of age

Assumptions: the residuals $\varepsilon_i$ follows a normal distribution with equal variance.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(step_backward_birthwt,which=1:2)
hist(birthwt$bwt,breaks=20)
```


Test statistic: $T=\frac{\bar{\beta_4}}{SE(\bar{\beta_4})}$which follows a t distribution with $n-p$ degrees of freedom under $H_0$.

Observed Test Statistics: $t_0=-0.984$

p-value: $2P(t_{n-p}>=|t_0|)=2P(t_{180}>=-0.984)=0.33>0.05$

Conclusion: We do not reject as the p-value is quite large. Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that there is a significant relationship between birth weight and mother's age, so it could be dropped from the model.

# Conclusion and Limitation
.scroll-output[
.pull-left[
## Limitation

1. Since the data comes from Baystate Medical Center, it does not have good universality and integrity, which reduces the accuracy of the results.
 
2. The reason why there is a fault occur in the residuals plot may be due to the difference between male and female. Because we did not consider gender differences in analysis variables, under other same conditions, birth weight of the male infants may be higher than that of the female infants, which could resulting in fault in the residuals plot.
 
3. In order to study the main related factors affecting infant weight, we removed the relatively insignificant factors, which may lead to the deviation of the results.

.pull-right[
## Conclusion

Therefore, in order to have a healthy body when the baby is born, the mother should pay more attention to maintaining a healthy body and adequate nutrition during pregnancy. At the same time, the mother should maintain good living habits and mood during pregnancy, so as to create a good growth environment for the baby and be relatively strong at birth.
