#Abstract

Low Birth Weight(LBW) is one of the main 
predictors of infant mortality. This study undertakes 
analysis of various risk factors associated with LBW 
using Multiple Linear Regression Model, Akaike 
information criterion (AIC) and Cross 
Validation(CV). Racial difference, Smoking, 
Hypertension, Uterine irritability and Motherâ€™s 
weight are concluded as the most significant 
variables in the final reduced model. Limitations are 
clarified to enhance further research, and some 
suggestions related to prenatal care are offered to 
mothers to improve infant health.
